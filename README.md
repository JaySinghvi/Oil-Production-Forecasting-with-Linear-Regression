Developed a time series forecasting model to predict U.S. energy consumption using XGBoost. 
Leveraged hourly power consumption data from PJM Interconnection LLC, a regional transmission organization, ensuring data quality through rigorous preprocessing and outlier removal. 
Trained the model using XGB Regressor with cross-validation, achieving high accuracy and consistency with historical trends, providing valuable insights for energy planning and optimization.
